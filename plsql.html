        <h4>PL/SQL Constants</h4>
        <p>A constant is a value used in a PL/SQL block that remains unchanged throughout the program. It is a
            user-defined literal value. It can be declared and used instead of actual values.

        <h4>PL/SQL Constants</h4>
        A constant is a value used in a PL/SQL block that remains unchanged throughout the program. It is a user-defined
        literal value. It can be declared and used instead of actual values.<br><br>

        Syntax:<br>
        constant_name CONSTANT datatype := VALUE;<br><br>
        <img src="images/ok.png">

        Constant_name:it is the name of constant just like variable name. The constant word is a reserved word and its
        value
        does not change.<br>
        VALUE: it is a value which is assigned to a constant when it is declared. It can not be assigned later.<br><br>

        <h3>CONTROL STATEMENTS</h3>
        <h4>PL/SQL If</h4>
        PL/SQL supports the programming language features like conditional statements and iterative statements.<br><br>

        Syntax: (IF-THEN statement):<br>
        <img src="images/ifthen.png">

        IF condition<br>
        THEN<br>
        Statement: {It is executed when condition is true}<br>
        END IF;<br>
        This syntax is used when you want to execute statements only when condition is TRUE.<br><br>

        Syntax: (IF-THEN-ELSE statement):<br>
        IF condition<br>
        THEN<br>
        {...statements to execute when condition is TRUE...}<br>
        ELSE<br>
        {...statements to execute when condition is FALSE...}<br>
        END IF;<br>
        This syntax is used when you want to execute one set of statements when condition is TRUE or a different set of
        statements when condition is FALSE.<br><br>
        <img src="images/imp.png">

        <h4> PL/SQL Loop</h4>
        The PL/SQL loops are used to repeat the execution of one or more statements for specified number of times. These
        are
        also known as iterative control statements.<br><br>

        Syntax:<br>
        LOOP<br>
        Sequence of statements;<br>
        END LOOP;<br>
        <img src="images/exit.png">

        <h4> PL/SQL Exit Loop</h4>
        PL/SQL exit loop is used when a set of statements is to be executed at least once before the termination of the
        loop. There must be an EXIT condition specified in the loop, otherwise the loop will get into an infinite number
        of
        iterations. After the occurrence of EXIT condition, the process exits the loop.<br><br>

        Syntax:<br>
        LOOP<br>
        statements;<br>
        EXIT;<br>
        {or EXIT WHEN condition;}<br>
        END LOOP;<br>
        <img src="images/exit.png">

        <h4>PL/SQL While Loop</h4>
        PL/SQL while loop is used when a set of statements has to be executed as long as a condition is true, the While
        loop
        is used. The condition is decided at the beginning of each iteration and continues until the condition becomes
        false.<br><br>

        Syntax:<br>
        WHILE (condition)<br>
        LOOP statements;<br>
        END LOOP;<br>
        <img src="images/while.png">

        <h4>PL/SQL For Loop</h4>
        PL/SQL for loop is used when when you want to execute a set of statements for a predetermined number of times.
        The
        loop is iterated between the start and end integer values. The counter is always incremented by 1 and once the
        counter reaches the value of end integer, the loop ends.<br><br>

        Syntax:<br><br>
        FOR counter IN initial_value .. final_value LOOP<br>
        LOOP statements;<br>
        END LOOP;<br><br>
        <img src="images/for.png">
        initial_value : Start integer value<br>
        final_value : End integer value<br><br>

        <h4> PL/SQL GOTO Statement</h4> <br>
        In PL/SQL, GOTO statement makes you able to get an unconditional jump from the GOTO to a specific executable
        statement label in the same subprogram of the PL/SQL block. Here the label declaration which contains the
        label_name
        encapsulated within the '<<h4>>' symbol and must be followed by at least one statement to execute.<br><br>

            Syntax:<br>
            GOTO label_name;<br><br>
            <img src="images/goto.png">

            <h3>PROCEDURES</h3>
            The PL/SQL stored procedure or simply a procedure is a PL/SQL block which performs one or more specific
            tasks.
            It is just like procedures in other programming languages. The procedure contains a header and a body.
            Header: The header contains the name of the procedure and the parameters or variables passed to the
            procedure.<br>
            Body: The body contains a declaration section, execution section and exception section similar to a general
            PL/SQL block.<br><br>

            Syntax:<br>
            CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE procedure_name<br>
            [ (parameter [,parameter]) ]<br>
            IS<br>
            [declaration_section]<br>
            BEGIN<br>
            executable_section<br>
            [EXCEPTION exception_section]<br>
            END [procedure_name];<br>
            <img src="images/creat.png">


            Syntax:<br>
            DROP PROCEDURE procedure_name;<br>
            <img src="images/drop.png">

            <h3>FUNCTIONS</h3>
            The PL/SQL Function is very similar to PL/SQL Procedure. The main difference between procedure and a
            function
            is, a function must always return a value, and on the other hand a procedure may or may not return a value.
            Except this, all the other things of PL/SQL procedure are true for PL/SQL function too.<br><br>

            Syntax:<br>
            CREATE [OR REPLACE] FUNCTION function_name [parameters]<br>
            [(parameter_name [IN | OUT | IN OUT] type [, ...])]<br>
            RETURN return_datatype<br>
            {IS | AS}<br>
            BEGIN<br>
            (function_body)<br>
            <img src="images/createfun.png">


            <h3>CURSORS</h3>
            When an SQL statement is processed, Oracle creates a memory area known as context area. A cursor is a
            pointer to
            this context area. It contains all information needed for processing the statement. In PL/SQL, the context
            area
            is controlled by Cursor. A cursor contains information on a select statement and the rows of data accessed
            by
            it. A cursor is used to referred to a program to fetch and process the rows returned by the SQL statement,
            one
            at a time.<br><br>
            There are two types of cursors:<br>

            1.PL/SQL Implicit Cursors<br>
            The implicit cursors are automatically generated by Oracle while an SQL statement is executed, if you don't
            use
            an explicit cursor for the statement. These are created by default to process the statements when DML
            statements
            like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE etc. are executed. Orcale provides some attributes known as Implicit cursor's
            attributes to check the status of DML operations. Some of them are: %FOUND, %NOTFOUND, %ROWCOUNT and
            %ISOPEN.
            For example: When you execute the SQL statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE then the cursor attributes tell
            whether any rows are affected and how many have been affected. If you run a SELECT INTO statement in PL/SQL
            block, the implicit cursor attribute can be used to find out whether any row has been returned by the SELECT
            statement. It will return an error if there no data is selected.<br>

            2.PL/SQL Explicit Cursors<br>
            The Explicit cursors are defined by the programmers to gain more control over the context area. These
            cursors
            should be defined in the declaration section of the PL/SQL block. It is created on a SELECT statement which
            returns more than one row.<br><br>

            Syntax:<br>
            CURSOR cursor_name IS select_statement;<br><br>
            <img src="images/">

            <h3>EXCEPTION HANDLING</h3>
            An error occurs during the program execution is called Exception in PL/SQL. PL/SQL facilitates programmers
            to
            catch such conditions using exception block in the program and an appropriate action is taken against the
            error
            condition.<br><br>

            PL/SQL Exception Handling<br>
            Syntax:<br>
            DECLARE<br>
            (declarations section)<br>
            BEGIN<br>
            (executable command(s))<br>
            EXCEPTION<br>
            (exception handling goes here)<br>
            WHEN exception1 THEN<br>
            exception1-handling-statements<br>
            WHEN exception2 THEN<br>
            exception2-handling-state<br>
            ments WHEN exception3 THEN<br>
            exception3-handling-statements<br>
            ........<br>
            WHEN others THEN<br>
            exception3-handling-statements<br>
            END;<br>
            <img src="images/eh.png">

            <h3>TRIGGERS</h3>
            Trigger is invoked by Oracle engine automatically whenever a specified event occurs.Trigger is stored into
            database and invoked repeatedly, when specific condition match. Triggers are stored programs, which are
            automatically executed or fired when some event occurs. Triggers are written to be executed in response to
            any
            of the following events.<br>
            A database manipulation (DML) statement (DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE).<br>
            A database definition (DDL) statement (CREATE, ALTER, or DROP).<br>
            A database operation (SERVERERROR, LOGON, LOGOFF, STARTUP, or SHUTDOWN).<br>
            Triggers could be defined on the table, view, schema, or database with which the event is
            associated.<br><br>
            <h4>
                Creating a trigger:</h4><br>
            Syntax:<br>
            CREATE [OR REPLACE ] TRIGGER trigger_name<br>
            {BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF }<br>
            {INSERT [OR] | UPDATE [OR] | DELETE}<br>
